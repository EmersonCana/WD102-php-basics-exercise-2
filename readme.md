# Exercise: Student Management System

**Objective:** Create a PHP script that manages a list of students. The script should allow you to add students, update their grades, remove students, and display the student list.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Create an Array of Students:**
   - Initialize an associative array to store the students. Each student should have a name and an array of grades.

2. **Create Functions:**
   - `addStudent`: This function should add a new student to the list.
   - `updateStudentGrades`: This function should update the grades of an existing student.
   - `removeStudent`: This function should remove a student from the list.
   - `displayStudents`: This function should display the list of students and their grades.

3. **Use Conditions and Loops:**
   - Use conditional statements to check if a student already exists when adding or updating.
   - Use loops to iterate through the student array when displaying the students.

4. **Test Your Functions:**
   - Call each function with sample data to test if your student management system works as expected.
